                ‚ÄúOne of the best Dental Surgeons in Delhi NCR and also the most
                experienced one. I have visited multiple dentists before but he
                has a very jolly nature and he also educate you about the
                treatments and precautions for better gum and teeth health. I
                got dental implants done by him at his Palam Vihar Clinic in
                Gurgaon, though I stay in Delhi as someone suggested me from
                Dwarka. He has a completely different approach to his profession
                and we have become like friends now after multiple visits‚Äù

                I will highly recommend him fir those looking for dental

                ‚ÄúI was 23 when I decided to go for braces, and Dr. Vinayak made
                the journey so comfortable. He gave me the option of ceramic
                braces and explained the pros and cons very transparently. Over
                the course of 15 months, I could see gradual but consistent
                improvements. Now I smile with confidence and couldn‚Äôt be
                happier. His follow-up care is exceptional.‚Äù
